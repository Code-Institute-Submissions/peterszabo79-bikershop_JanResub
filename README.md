### Debugging and known bugs



### Deployment

#### Publishing
The project was deployed using Heroku. The process is as follows:

Once you have signed up to Heroku, on the top right of the dashboard there is a button labelled 'New'. This will open a dropdown; please select 'Create new app'. On the next page you can choose your region and a name for the project. Then click 'Create app'.

On the next page there is a menu along the top. Navigate to 'Settings', where you will find the config vars. Scroll down to the section named 'Config vars' and click on the button labelled 'Reveal config vars'. Cloudinary and ElephantSQL will both need config vars as per your own details. You will also need to set a secret key. Once the config vars are saved, back in Gitpod save them in an env.py file. Make sure to add env.py to your .gitignore list so that your config vars do not become publically available on Github.

If you scroll back to the top of the page you will find the 'Deploy' tab, which has multiple options for deployment. I used Github for this project. When you click on the Github button a bar will come up for you to search for the repo you wish to connect to.

Once you have connected, you have the option to deploy automatically (the app will update every time you push) or manually (update only when you choose). I chose automatic but you can do what suits you.

After the first push/update, your app will be ready to go!

#### Forking and Cloning

To save a copy of the code and work on it yourself, here are the steps for forking and cloning using Github:
In the repository, click the 'Fork' button, which is on the top right-hand side, next to 'Star'.

Github will automatically create a new repo, which is forked from the original. If you would like to clone it you have two options:
Within the repository, click the 'Code' dropdown, which is located next to 'Add File' on the right (underneath the Settings tab); there is an option to download all files and save a copy locally.

In the same 'Code' dropdown, you can opt to open the code with GitHub Desktop and work from there.
